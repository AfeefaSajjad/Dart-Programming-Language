Built-in Functions:

  Built-in functions are pre-defined functions that are provided by the Dart language or libraries. 
  They are readily available for you to use without requiring any additional setup or configuration.
 
  Built-in functions provide common functionalities and utility operations. Here are a few examples of built-in
    functions in Dart:

  print(): Prints the specified message to the console.
  sqrt(): Computes the square root of a given number.
  toUpperCase(): Converts a string to uppercase.
  toLowerCase(): Converts a string to lowercase.
  sort(): Sorts a list in ascending order.
  toString(): Converts an object to its string representation.

  Built-in functions are part of the Dart language or external libraries.
  They are typically documented, and you can readily use them by calling their names and providing the required arguments.
