void main() {
/* Loops:

Loops are an essential concept in programming that allow us to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a certain 
condition or for a specified number of times. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and make programs more 
efficient and flexible. Loops provide a way to iterate over a collection of data or perform a specific action until a 
particular condition is met.


Different types of loops in Dart:

for loop:
       Executes a block of code for a specific number of times based on a defined condition.

while loop:
           Continuously executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

do-while loop: 
            Executes a block of code at least once and then repeats the execution as long as a given condition is true.

for-in loop: 
          Iterates over the elements of a collection  and executes a block of code for each element.
