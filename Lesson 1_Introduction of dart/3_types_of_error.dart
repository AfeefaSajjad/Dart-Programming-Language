  /*

    Errors or bugs in programming refer to issues or defects in the code that cause it to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect results. They can occur due to various reasons, including mistakes in the code logic, syntax errors, incorrect data handling, or external factors.

    Errors can manifest in different forms and impact the functionality, performance, or user experience of the software. Some common types of errors include:

    1. Syntax Errors
    2. Logical Errors
    3. Runtime Errors

  */

  // 1. Syntax Errors
  // These errors occur when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language. It could be a missing or misplaced symbol, incorrect keyword usage, or improper punctuation. Syntax errors are typically detected by the compiler or interpreter during the compilation process and prevent the code from running. 

  print("Error");

  // 2. Logical Error

  // add to number (+)
  print(10 - 7);

  // 3. Run Time Error 

  //This is the type of error that occurs during runtime.
