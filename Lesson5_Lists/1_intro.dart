/* List

 A list is an ordered collection of items in Dart. It allows you to store and manipulate multiple values of different types under a single variable name and access them by their index.


Types of List 

1. Growable List
2. Fixed Length List

 1. Growable List

  A growable list is a dynamic list that can change its size dynamically during runtime.
  It can grow or shrink based on the number of items you add or remove from it.



//2. Fixed Length List

  A fixed-length list is a list with a predetermined size that cannot change once defined.
  It has a fixed number of elements that you specify when creating the list.
