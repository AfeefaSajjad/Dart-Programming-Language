// Map

//  A map is a collection of key-value pairs in Dart.
// It is also known as an associative array, dictionary, or hash table in other programming languages. /
//Maps provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data based on a unique key.



//Each key in a map must be unique. 
//Duplicate keys are not allowed, and attempting to add a key that already exists will replace the previous value associated with that key.
